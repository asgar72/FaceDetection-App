# FaceDetection-App
This is Face detection app created by android, Java, firebase, MT kit..

The Face Detection App, developed using Android, Java, Firebase, and the MT Kit, is a powerful and user-friendly application designed to detect and analyze faces in real-time using the device's camera or images from the gallery.

Using the app is as simple as opening the camera or selecting an image from your gallery. Once the app recognizes a face, it swiftly analyzes various facial features and provides detailed information on the screen. The primary features the app focuses on are smile detection, left eye openness, and right eye openness.

After detecting a face, the app calculates the percentage of the detected smile, which indicates the degree to which the person is smiling. It accurately captures even subtle smiles and displays the percentage to give you an idea of the person's happiness or expression.

In addition to smile detection, the app also evaluates the openness of the left and right eyes individually. It calculates the percentage of eye openness, providing an insight into whether the person's eyes are closed, partially open, or wide open. This information can be useful in various scenarios, such as monitoring fatigue, drowsiness, or even assessing the engagement level of a person during a conversation or presentation.
